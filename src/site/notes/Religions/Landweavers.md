# Landweavers
 The Landweavers are devoted to [[NPCs/Deities/ðŸª¨ Dhedros, God of the Land\|ðŸª¨ Dhedros, God of the Land]], serving as protectors and stewards of the natural world. They believe the earth has always existed and must be safeguarded from those who would exploit or defile it, whether through greed, corruption, or carelessness. Their faith centers on harmony with nature, sustainable living, and the nurturing of all life, with seasonal festivals and rituals held in forests, meadows, and sacred groves to honor the cycles of the earth. While most followers dedicate themselves to preservation and balance, some extremists place the well-being of the land above even human life. Empowered by [[NPCs/Deities/ðŸª¨ Dhedros, God of the Land\|Dhedros]] to draw strength from the earth itself, Landweavers wield both divine blessings and political influence, shaping laws and communities around conservation and respect for the land. To them, the soil, the seasons, and the life they sustain are not mere resources, but sacred gifts entrusted to their care.
