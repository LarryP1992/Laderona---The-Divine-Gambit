# Guardians of the Night 
 The faithful of the Moonlit Goddess, [[NPCs/Deities/ðŸŒ™ Ontrix, Goddess of the Night\|ðŸŒ™ Ontrix, Goddess of the Night]], walk a path of mystery and vigilance, revering the night as a sacred veil of introspection, magic, and hidden truths. Known as the Guardians of the Night, her followers embrace both the beauty and peril of darkness, believing the moon and stars guide mortals through shadows toward wisdom and redemption. Worship is carried out beneath moonlit skies or in hidden sanctuaries, where offerings of moonflowers, crystals, and silver honor her presence. Devotees dedicate themselves to protecting the vulnerable, guiding lost souls, and standing as watchful sentinels against corruption and chaos. Gifted with powers of shadow and insight, they serve as both mystics and defenders, balancing secrecy with compassion. Their influence shapes communities through networks of guardianship and, at times, shadowy intrigue, making the faith not only a spiritual order but a force of protection, balance, and ever-watchful vigilance in the dark.
