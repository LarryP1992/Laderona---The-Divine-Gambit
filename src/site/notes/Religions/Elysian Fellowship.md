# Elysian Fellowship
 The Elysian Fellowship is a faith devoted to [[NPCs/Deities/ðŸŒ¿ Quton, God of Life\|ðŸŒ¿ Quton, God of Life]], whose breath is said to have sparked creation and whose light continues to nurture all living things. Followers believe life is a sacred gift and strive to honor it through compassion, service, and community. Worship is expressed both in ritualâ€”through offerings of fruits, flowers, and song in sacred groves and templesâ€”and in deed, with members dedicating themselves to healing the sick, aiding the needy, and protecting the vulnerable. Their tenets emphasize kindness, justice, and unity, guiding adherents to see hope even in the darkest times. While anyone can embody these values, true membership in the Fellowship, whether as a servant of the faith or as a knight in its ranks, begins only upon coming of age. Through their devotion, the Elysian Fellowship has become not just a spiritual order but a pillar of society, shaping communities and governance around the principles of care, renewal, and the flourishing of all life.
