# Creation (0-227)

In the beginning, the Gods crafted the world in all its beauty and wonder, shaping the land, skies, and seas. Life flourished under their divine care, but darkness stirred beyond the mortal plane. From the depths of Hell, creatures found a way to enter this pristine world, slipping through unseen cracks and threatening the harmony the Gods had created.

# Elysian Redemption (227-1215)

As the Hellish creatures poured into the world, the Gods, alongside their celestial army of angels, fought fiercely to protect their creation. The portals connecting Hell to the mortal realm were eventually closed, but not before some of the fiendish invaders were trapped on the mortal side. In this great battle, Amon, one of the Greater Gods, was slain, and his divine responsibilities had to be divided among the remaining Gods, who resumed their duties with heavy hearts.

With Amon gone, the remaining fiends were left for the mortals to defeat. To aid them, the Gods left behind powerful relics—artifacts imbued with divine magic—to help defend against these lingering threats. In the frozen wasteland known as the Ivory Expanse, it is believed that all Hellish creatures were frozen solid. To this day, eerie ice sculptures of fiends remain on the other side of the Spine, a chilling reminder of the battle. No one knows if any dragons survived, as the air in the region is too frigid for long-term exploration.

# New Age (1215-1533)

After the chaos, the world began to heal. The people of Laderona—descendants of various heritages—started rebuilding their cities and settlements, using the abundant resources the Gods had infused into the land. But the peace did not last. The Legion, remnants of the Hellish forces, attacked once more. This time, however, the mortals fought without the direct aid of the Gods.

The divine relics left behind proved crucial in these battles. Wielders of the artifacts fought off the larger fiends, pushing the remaining Hellish forces back. Yet, after the final battles, the relics vanished. Whether they were lost, hidden, or moved by the natural magic of the world, they have not been seen since.

# The Great Fortification (1534-1551)

In the aftermath of the Legion's defeat, the heritages of Laderona set about fortifying their cities, building grand walls and fortresses. Many of these cities were constructed in naturally defensible locations—nestled against mountainsides, atop hills, or protected by sheer cliffs. This gave them a strategic advantage against future threats. While not all villages and towns could be as well defended, these smaller settlements were essential to the survival of the people.

During this period, explorers set sail around the vast frozen region known as the Ivory Expanse, mapping its size and treacherous terrain. However, since the Great Fortification and the last attack by the Legion, no expedition has been undertaken. Whether the frozen lands have thawed in the farthest reaches remains a mystery.

# Rise of the Guardians (1551 - Present, 2547)

Today, the era is known as the Rise of the Guardians. Mortals train other mortals, spreading the teachings of the Gods and protecting the vulnerable from the lingering threats of the world. Though the battles of old have ended, Fiendish Lords continue to try and worm their way back into the mortal plane. Through deception and manipulation, they prey on the weak-minded, seeking to regain a foothold.

Yet, devotion to the Gods offers strength. Worshipping the divine grants blessings to the land, fortifying the people’s efforts and ensuring Laderona continues to thrive under the watchful eyes of the Guardians.
