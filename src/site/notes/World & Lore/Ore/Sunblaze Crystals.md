# Sunblaze Crystals
The Crystal grown in clusters in the [Sun Striped Plains](app://obsidian.md/Sun%20Striped%20Plains), guarded by the [Sunstone Guardians](app://obsidian.md/Sunstone%20Guardians). 

The crystals were placed by [Zaldir, Primal of the Sun](app://obsidian.md/Zaldir,%20Primal%20of%20the%20Sun) to repel the portals that can open at the specific locations. For each crystal that is removed, a portal can open, releasing Demons into the plains.

Anyone caught with a Sunblaze Crystal is arrested immediately and will be publicly executed for endangering the Mortal Realm.
