# Sunblaze Crystals
The Crystal grown in clusters in theÂ [[Sun Striped Plains\|Sun Striped Plains]], guarded by theÂ [[Sunstone Guardians\|Sunstone Guardians]]. 

The crystals were placed byÂ [[NPCs/Deities/ðŸ”† Zaldir, Primal of the Sun\|Zaldir]]Â to repel the portals that can open at the specific locations. For each crystal that is removed, a portal can open, releasing Demons into the plains.

Anyone caught with a Sunblaze Crystal is arrested immediately and will be publicly executed for endangering the Mortal Realm.
