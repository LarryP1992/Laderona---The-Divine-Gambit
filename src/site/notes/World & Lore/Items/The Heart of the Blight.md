# October  22, 2025: The Heart of the Blight

Leaving behind the cold, stone corridors of the dungeon, you emerged into a strange, humid forest — its air thick with rot and decay, the ground pulsing faintly with necrotic energy. Your path forward was soon blocked by a wall of massive, thorned vines. Along the trail stood several ancient stone pillars, each etched with fading runes. When touched, only a few responded with a faint glow — and when all the right pillars were activated at once, the thorn wall unraveled, revealing the path ahead.

Following the signs left by the glowing runes, you wound deeper into the forest, navigating by the symbols’ guidance and avoiding the warped, blight-twisted creatures that prowled through the shadows. The air grew heavier with corruption until finally, you reached the forest’s heart — a massive, ancient tree whose roots bled black ichor.

At its base writhed the source of the corruption: a Maw-Worm, a fiendish parasite gnawing at the tree’s roots. The battle was fierce, but with blade, spell, and resolve, you struck it down. Yet victory was hollow — the tree remained sick, its vitality fading.

Then Alban remembered the scroll discovered in the depths below: a **ritual of restoration**, one meant to heal not only the body, but the land itself. As Alban began the delicate ritual, the ground trembled — the forest’s blighted guardians surged toward you, drawn to defend the dying corruption.

Now, with the air thick with necrotic mist and the cries of twisted beasts echoing through the trees, you stand your ground, forming a defensive ring around Alban as he works. The blight treants advance through the darkened grove, and the snarling of blight wolves rises from the undergrowth.

Hold fast — if Alban falls or the ritual is broken, the heart of the forest may never heal.
