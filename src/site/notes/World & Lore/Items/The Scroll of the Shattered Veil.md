# Scroll of the Shattered Veil

> This ancient scroll, cradled in gold and sealed within the resting place of a forgotten Primal, is written in <!-- the sacred tongue of the Primal of Death --> a sacred tongue. Each deciphered section binds deeper truths of the Beyond into the soul of the bearer. As a sorcerer, you feel its energy resonate with your blood—power recognizing power.

### Description
The Scroll is written in [[World & Lore/General Lore/Vox Umbrarum - Noctisong\|Vox Umbrarum - Noctisong]], the ancient language of the Primal of Death. The Scroll looks to be broken up into several verses, like a song, with some sections repeating itself. 

Spending any duration of time with the scroll on ones person, they feel the scroll begin to intertwine with their soul.

Singing / Speaking the words, and committing them to memory, allows the creature similar effects to casting spells and granting features.

The scrolls reads as follows with the translation to the right.

### Verse I: <!-- The Kinship Veiled -->

>Il'she ven tharan, veth’kai dorin vae shuur. En'kai lumira'th silna ven’tal vorrin'kai tor elune. Shari'mor ven kaleth.
<!--
📜 Translation

> “You are of my line, though the blood may be thin. In you stirs the spark that once sang across the stars. Let me show you who we were.”

The first passage of the scroll glows faintly as you decipher it. In the flicker of your candlelight, shadows seem to dance in the shape of a man standing beside a winged figure. The words form in your mind—not just as knowledge, but as **memory**.

#### Effects
- **Legacy of the Veiled Flame:**  
    When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a **d6**. On a **5 or 6**, you gain **temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier × the spell's level**.  
    These temporary hit points **do not stack** but may be refreshed on a new spellcast roll.
    
- **Veil of Mist (Reaction):**  
    When you take damage, you may use your **reaction** to be momentarily wreathed in **shadowy mist**, gaining **resistance to that instance of the damage** you just took.  
    You may use this reaction a number of times per long rest equal to your **proficiency bonus**.
    
- **Eyes of the Veil:**  
    You gain **darkvision to 60 feet**. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.  
    _(This feature may evolve into Truesight in a future Verse.)_

### Verse II – Ashes of the Forgotten Sun

>Kel'nor vas'thal drav. Vel shan ir'kai. Vel'sael thurin'na et vorrak—naen vurel. En'shall vora'sai lumir kai velar en’dathil moran’kai thurin.
-->
<!--
📜 Translation

>“They called me the End. But I was the balance. The silence that follows not destruction—but release. I walked beside the light so that others could find peace in the dark.”

As the second verse reveals itself, the parchment smolders faintly, casting an eerie twilight glow across the room. For a brief moment, everything is silent—no heartbeat, no breath, no sound. Then the scroll pulses, and vision returns sharper, deeper, as though a veil had been lifted.

#### Effects
- Eyes of Dusk and Dawn  
    Your sight expands into the deepest shadows.  
	- You gain darkvision to 120 feet.
	- You can now see through magical darkness.
	- In dim light or darkness, you have advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight
- Legacy Spell: Withering Pulse  
    You gain the following unique 2nd-level necromancy spell through the scroll. It is counted as a known spell and does not count against the number of spells you can know.
- [[Withering Pulse\|Withering Pulse]] - [[Rare Spells\|Rare Spells]]

The final line of the verse glows faintly as it burns into your memory: “Let them fear the silence, not the shadow.”
-->
<!--
### Verse III – The Fading Flame

>Vel torin’tai. Elune’kai var'sul. Lor'tai shanar... sith varun. Vel thal’rem sol’kai, en’sar ven shari. Velar’an tul, ir’kai doraan.
-->
<!--
📜 Translation

>“I am not what I once was. The star has dimmed. The source is… lost to me. But the flame endures, even if only as a shadow. Even in exile, I remain.”

When the third verse reveals itself, the scroll grows cold in your hands. The ink does not glow—it bleeds. Not pain, but silence. Not rage, but absence. You feel, briefly, what it is to be almost forgotten, and still reach for meaning.

#### Effects
- Residual Divine Spark  
    When you expend your last sorcery point, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, you immediately regain 1d4 sorcery points as a flicker of ancient power stirs in your blood.  
    (Usable once per long rest.)
- Legacy Spell – Step Through the Shroud  
    You gain the following 3rd-level transmutation spell through the scroll:

Step Through the Shroud
3rd-level transmutation, action, self
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You exist partially in the world of the dead, flickering between presence and shadow.

- You are heavily obscured to creatures more than 30 feet away
- You may move through hostile creatures’ spaces and through solid objects as if incorporeal
- Your speed is halved while inside objects
- If you end your turn inside a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage
- Creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you while the spell is active

You may cast this spell once per long rest without expending a spell slot. You may also learn it as a spell known.

Your reflection no longer mirrors you. It lags, like something watching from just behind the Veil.

<!--
### Verse IV – _The Last Ember_ (Currently Hidden)
The final verse is the most difficult to decipher, as it seems to be an added verse (after the scrolls creation, but how did he add the content without holding it?)

This verse is a poem of a sort, that once its meaning is revealed leads to him and that he had married. Summoning him with this poem will reveal the Primal of Death in all of his might, momentarily (24 hours) granting his power back at full to seek his bride in the frigid climate of [[The Ivory Expanse\|The Ivory Expanse]], into the plane of [[Cryos\|Cryos]]. Once they are reunited, they will be able to free the Dragons from their slumber, and they will, once again, be ready for [[Legion\|Legion]].

==_Unlocks at level 12+ upon full translation of the scroll_==

_This verse is not etched in ink. It appears only when the bearer completes the others — **willed into existence by Amon himself**. Its words glow like burning silver, flickering into form, line by line, as the bearer sleeps beside the scroll for the final time._

 _Unlike the other verses, this one is not a message. It is a **poem**, heavy with metaphor and bound by ancient oath._

 _Its truth can only be deciphered through arcane insight, divine communion, or soul-deep intuition._
 _Its purpose: to **summon Amon** — not as a memory or whisper, but in **his full, mythic form**._

>“Tor'valen shur a’kai, veth’lan mor'kai sil’reth, 
Sha’vurin dosh’kai thalur, mir'anar sen'kai vurel.” 
“Nel’sha dorai’vun, nel'uth kor vath’ir,
Nel’kai lun’athil sha’vel thurin ven’ar.”

>“Vesh tal Vox’irum sha’val kor'unai,
Kael’therum dorith shal sol’kai mir’drax.”
“Vel’karan dor’kai vurel’kai lun,
Sha’var ith’alor, sha’nulor, sha’doran."

 📜 Translation

> “When flame forgets its fire, and shadow sleeps in snow,
> When starlight bleeds through ice, and mercy learns to grow,
> Call me not in fury, nor vengeance, nor plea—
> Call me only when love dares the cold to break free.”
> 
> “Speak this in the Veiled Tongue beneath a broken sky,
> Where frost has devoured the sun and dragons lie.
> Then shall I rise for a single day’s breath,
> And burn back the silence, the slumber, the death.”

### 🔥 **Activation Effect — Once the Poem is Understood & Spoken**

When the bearer **fully understands the poem’s meaning**, and **recites it aloud in Vox Umbrarum** upon the frozen threshold of **The Ivory Expanse**, the following occurs:

- The sky splits with a **pulse of black starlight**.
- [[Amon, Primal of Death\|Amon, Primal of Death]],  **manifests fully**, drawn by his final tether: love, sealed by oath and poem.
- For **24 hours**, Amon regains his **true form and full divine strength**.
- His focus is singular: to reach his **bride**, imprisoned deep within the plane of **Cryos**, across the polar gate known as **The Ivory Expanse**.
