**Page 1**  
My Queen, I have heard troubling whispers. They say that [[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]] betrayed the Gods. That he lured away the our General to steal her power — to rule in your place.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>Foolish child. Do not speak of trust among demons. Power is the only truth. If</span></strong> **[[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]]** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>desired dominion, he would have already made it known. The General was useful, and powerful. I am certain she lives. She needs to be found to aid in our quest to bring paradise to the Mortal Realm.</strong></span>

But none have seen Amon or the General since the [[World & Lore/Laderona Timeline#Elysian Redemption (227-1215)\|Elysian Redemption]]. Nor the dragons. Are they hiding in the lands east of [[The Spine\|The Spine]]? That frigid waste would destroy even your kind. We can't navigate the [[Ivory Expanse\|Ivory Expanse]].

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>Yes. The</strong></span> **[[Ivory Expanse\|Ivory Expanse]]** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>shelters secrets long buried. You cannot enter — your blood is too thin. But I can guide you. We continue our efforts to find a way into the expanse. Even if we need to increase recruitment and send lesser members and magically send messages...or even dominate them or nearby civilians and you can control them into the Expanse to see what we need to see without putting you and the more devoted in harms way</strong></span>

Then what is your will? How do we bring [[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]] back?

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>Find the </strong></span>**[[Crown of Eternal Passage\|Crown of Eternal Passage]]**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>. One of its fragments has revealed itself in </strong></span>**[[Theltgalor\|Theltgalor]]**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>. Conveniently, it is near one of</strong></span> **[[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]]**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>'s temples before the Mortals turned their allegiance. Retrieve it, and I shall show you the ritual to find the next piece. When all of the relics are collected, we will be able to summon</strong></span> **[[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]]**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>. We will demand his truth.</strong></span>

**Page 4**  
Is there certain knowledge the Gods have forbidden Mortals to know? It seems they, and the Godlings, keep us blind of many truths. 

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>The gods are liars and deceits. There are even some knowledges I am not privy to. I do know, the</strong></span> **[[World & Lore/Ore/Sunblaze Crystals\|Sunblaze Crystals]]** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>are Laderona’s greatest protection — and its greatest vulnerability. We shall use this power to strengthen our own.</strong></span>

We just sent messengers to supply the Witherking in the Shambled Forest with another pouch of Sunblaze Crystals. They seem to be going through them more quickly than before, demanding more frequent than they grow. Now another group has began harvesting the Crystals, as well. I believe them to be [[The Forgemasters\|The Forgemasters]]. 
  
<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>Good.</strong></span> **[[The Witherking\|The Witherking]]** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>is a formidable ally, as you are. They continue allow our forces who get through to be stronger on their lands. Keeping him and his tribe operational helps us.</strong></span>

The Sunblaze stockpiles grow thin. Some among the lesser priests question this path.


<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>Silence them. Doubt is poison. My promises remain: Serve me, and when paradise opens, you and your people shall walk unchallenged in the new order.</strong></span>

My Queen, we have recovered a partial translation of the Scroll. The script is fragmented, a fusion of Infernal and Abyssal, but inconsistent. The scholars cannot decipher all.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>Don't waste your time. We have not been able to untangle</strong></span> **[[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]]**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>'s language for centuries. I do not expect mortals to make any additional headway. The ritual to summon</strong></span> **[[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]]** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong>is more important. Focus all efforts on finding the Temples and fragments of The Crown</strong></span>

**Page 8**  
We have word that the messengers have located the first fragment and will be retrieving it in 4 days. We are already prepared to accept the item in [[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]]'s temple.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Go. I will send the</span> **[[Chthonian Maw\|Chthonian Maw]]** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">to aid in your endeavors. He will bring chaos to the city while you do what is necessary. 

And remember: you are my voice in the silence. The road is perilous, but the faithful shall rise.</span>
