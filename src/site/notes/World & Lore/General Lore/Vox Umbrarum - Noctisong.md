# Vox Umbrarum - Noctisong
> Spoken only by the Primal of Death and his closest celestial kin, _Vox Umbrarum_ is not a secretâ€”it is a **sacred dialect**, reserved for speaking of the **soulâ€™s journey**, **love beyond death**, and the **balance of all things**. Only creatures touched by [[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord]] himself can understand the language.
### Description
- **Not Created to Hide** â€“ Amon did not create this language to exclude, but to **protect the sanctity of death** and the moments that come before and after.
- **Primal Rarity** â€“ Only [[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Amon]], his chosen one(s), and [[NPCs/Deities/ðŸ”† Zaldir, Primal of the Sun\|Zaldir]] were able to comprehend it. 
- **It is sung, not spoken** â€“ It resonates like wind in hollow stone, impossible to duplicate with magic alone.   
- **Fiends Cannot Comprehend It** â€“ Not because itâ€™s encrypted, but because **they lack the spiritual resonance** to grasp its meaning. It would be like trying to read music without knowing sound exists.
<!-- - **The Last Translator** â€“ A descendant of Amonâ€™s **Eclipsed Heralds** (messengers who served both Sun and Death) holds the final translations. A family tradition, full body tattoo holding the final fragments of a **harmonic key** that unlocks meaning through tone and intent. -->
