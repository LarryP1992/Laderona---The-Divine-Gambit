# Radiant Lotus
##### Visual:
Large, luminous flower with petals that shimmer like spun gold in the sunlight. Its petals unfurl in delicate layers, revealing a radiant center that glows with an inner light. Each petal is edged with a fine, iridescent fringe that sparkles with prismatic colors when touched by sunlight. The flower sits atop a sturdy stalk that rises gracefully.

##### Smell:
Intoxicatingly sweet, with notes of honey, citrus, and exotic spices. As the sun sets and the flower blooms, its fragrance fills the air with a heady aroma that soothes the senses and uplifts the spirit. The scent is reminiscent of warm summer days and tropical breezes, invoking feelings of joy, tranquility, and wonder.

##### Taste:
Subtle yet sublime, with hints of nectar and sunshine captured within its petals. Consuming a petal of the flower imparts a delicate sweetness on the palate, followed by a refreshing burst of citrus and floral notes. The taste is refreshing and invigorating, leaving a lingering sensation of warmth and vitality on the tongue. Some describe it as a taste of pure sunshine, filling the soul with light and nourishment.
