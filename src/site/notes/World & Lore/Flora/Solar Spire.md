# Solar Spires
##### Visual:
Think crab grass in appearance, but stark yellow blades make up 75% of the grass cluster. The edges that glisten in the sunlight, giving them a sharp, metallic sheen. In the middle of the cluster, a star-shaped flowers blooms in brilliant shades of yellow and orange, adding a splash of color to the surrounding landscape.

##### Smell:
Earthy scent that is reminiscent of freshly turned soil and sun-warmed grass. As the wind rustles through their leaves, it carries the fragrance across the plains, filling the air with a clean, refreshing aroma. Close up, the spires exude a faint hint of citrus and spice, adding a touch of exotic allure to their natural scent.

##### Taste:
Mildly tangy flavor with a hint of bitterness, similar to mustard greens.
