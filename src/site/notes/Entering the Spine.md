# August 13, 2025 : Entering the Spine
Silence fell over the camp as the last wight turned and fled, its shrieks echoing into the night. Though the battle was won, it was clear this was not the end of their presence.

Among the slain, [[Rokirus\|Rokirus]] discovered a grim truth—one of the wights was once a clansman of his own, now twisted into an undead mockery.

It was then that a new companion stepped forward. [[Arabar\|Arabar]], a fellow traveler seeking adventure, offered his respect. Recognizing Rokirus’ name and reputation, he kneeled and said:
*“I have heard of your great feats to protect my city. I am sorry for what has come upon you.”*

The party’s journey pressed on. Weeks passed as they wound their way through the harsh peaks of the Spine, closing in on the few day lead the assumed Legion Cultists had on them.

Though the trek was exhausting, clever use of spells and abilities kept disaster at bay, and luck remained on their side. At last, [[Alban\|Alban’s]] familiar soared ahead, peering around the bend of the pass… only to reveal a Goblin ambush waiting.

But Rokirus only smirked, stepping boldly forward.
*“It’s only an ambush if we don’t know it’s coming.”*
