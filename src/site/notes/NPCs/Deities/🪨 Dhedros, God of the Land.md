# 🪨 **Dhedros, God of the Land**

**Divine Role:** Shaper of Earth and Growth  
**Religion Group:** *[[Religions/Landweavers\|Landweavers]]*  
**Titles:** The Green Father, Warden of Roots, Stoneheart

### 🏞️ Lore & Beliefs

Dhedros does not often speak—instead, he _grows_. He is the slow heartbeat of the mountains, the creak of the forest, the thunder under the soil. Where he walks, new lands rise. Where he rests, trees break stone. His worship is strongest in deep wildernesses, terraced farms, and sacred groves.

It is said Dhedros carved the valleys of Laderona with his bare hands to give space for life to flourish. The druids of the Landweavers believe his spirit can still be spoken to in the Ancient Language of Stone.

His symbol is a rising mountain with a tree split through its peak.

### 🍃 Worship & Rites

- **Seasonal Rites:** Performed at equinoxes and solstices, involving ritual tilling, planting, or stonebreaking to bless the earth.
- **The Silence:** Once per year, all followers spend one day in nature without speech to listen for Dhedros’ presence.
- **Taboos:** Overcultivation, salt-based poisoning of land, or building without balance are all viewed as great sins.

### 🌿 Clerics & Powers

Dhedros’ divine powers revolve around terrain, endurance, and restorative growth.

- **Earth’s Resilience:** Hardens skin like bark or stone, increasing defense and stability.
- **Stonecall Communion:** Calls on spirits of rock and soil to reveal secrets or defend the faithful.
- **Rootbinding Grasp:** Entangles enemies in vines and roots that read intent—restraining only those who wish harm.

Landweaver symbols are often **wooden talismans**, **stone rune-crystals**, and **woven grass cords**, all worn with reverence.
