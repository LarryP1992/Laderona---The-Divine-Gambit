# 🔆 **Zaldir, Primal of the Sun**

**Divine Role:** Father of Flame and Dawn  
**Religion Group:** _The Dawnsworn_  
**Titles:** The Eternal Flame, The Sky-Father, First Light

### 🌞 Lore & Beliefs

Zaldir is the origin—first flame, first breath, first word. He shaped the stars with his voice and cast the sun to banish the void. While his children govern the elements of the world, Zaldir maintains the cosmic balance. He is said to rest behind the sun’s light, watching with eyes of fire.

Followers often believe Zaldir _is_ the sun, and that his passage across the sky is his tireless journey to inspect the mortal world daily.

In some remote cultures, Zaldir is portrayed as distant and unknowable—a divine judge who offers no second chances. Others see him as a stern but loving father, whose warmth is felt in moments of courage or sacrifice.

### 🔥 Worship & Rites

- **Day of Radiance:** Each month on the full sun (clear skies), the Dawnsworn gather to perform the Sunward Chant at noon.
- **Fire Offerings:** Pure offerings—fruits, spices, sacred oils—are cast into ceremonial fires at dawn.
- **Taboos:** Worshippers avoid being awake during the full night without light—considered disrespectful to Zaldir's cycle.

- **Sunfire Smite:** Radiant flame that cleanses corruption.
- **Solar Gaze:** Blinds fiends and undead in the caster’s sight.
- **Burning Revelation:** Visions of truth through dreams, often cryptic.
