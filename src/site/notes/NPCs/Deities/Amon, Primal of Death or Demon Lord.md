# Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord

There is little to no recorded text of Amon.

Legends say Amon was one of the weaker Gods, destroyed in the [[World & Lore/Laderona Timeline#Elysian Redemption (227-1215)\|Elysian Redemption]]  for his involvement with allowing the Demons into the Mortal Realm, as part of his plan to become more powerful.

Folklore says he was a God, sadly lost in the [[World & Lore/Laderona Timeline#Elysian Redemption (227-1215)\|Elysian Redemption]] to the invasion of the Demons.

A Cult by the name of Legion publicly pledges their loyalty to a shadow figure, which most elude to Amon.

The truth is unknown.
