# 📘 **Votia, Goddess of Wisdom**
**Divine Role:** The Mindful Matron  
**Religion Group:** *[[Sophic Scholars\|Sophic Scholars]]*  
**Titles:** The Silver Quill, Lady of Knowing, She Who Watches

### 📖 Lore & Beliefs

Votia is said to have spoken the first word that was not command, but contemplation. While [[NPCs/Deities/🔆 Zaldir, Primal of the Sun\|Zaldir]] gave the world form, Votia gave it _meaning_. She is the patron of scholars, tacticians, and seers. Her essence is found in moonlit libraries, battlefield strategies, and whispered omens alike.

It is believed that Votia records the outcomes of every mortal choice in her eternal library—the _Vault of Thought_—and uses them to guide those who seek truth over comfort.

Her symbol, a silver eye over an open tome, represents the idea that to learn is to see.

### ✒️ Worship & Rites

- **The Rite of Reflection:** Performed weekly; followers meditate in silence for a full hour to contemplate the past and prepare the mind.
- **Memory Vials:** Scholars and mages record personal revelations in enchanted glass and place them in public libraries to share insight with others.
- **Taboos:** Deliberate destruction of knowledge (especially written word) is blasphemy. Lying to protect oneself is tolerated; lying to harm others is not.

### 🧠 Clerics & Powers

Clerics of Votia excel in foresight, divination, and unraveling secrets. Her miracles often take the form of:

- **Insight Bloom:** A sudden surge of understanding; solves riddles, grants clarity.
- **Memory Seal:** Traps or hides knowledge within a person's mind or an object.
- **Eye of Silver Flame:** Reveals illusions and disguised truths in a shimmering glow.

Sacred implements include **inked sigils, feathered circlets, crystal quills**, and enchanted books bound in luminous leather.
