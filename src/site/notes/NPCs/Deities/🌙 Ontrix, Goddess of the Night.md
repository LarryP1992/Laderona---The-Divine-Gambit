# 🌙 **Ontrix, Goddess of the Night**

**Divine Role:** Warden of Dreams and the Dead  
**Religion Group:** *[[Religions/Guardians of the Night\|Guardians of the Night]]*  
**Titles:** The Shadowed Queen, She Who Walks Between, The Last Mercy

### 🌘 Lore & Beliefs

Ontrix is the protector of the vulnerable and the ferrier of souls. While others fear the dark, her followers **embrace it as sacred**. She walks through dreams and shadows, watching from between the stars. Though stoic and feared, she is not cruel—only just.

It is said that at death, the soul is presented to Ontrix in a silent court. Those who followed the gods are offered rest. Those who defied them are _refused_—left to roam until they fall into the Hells or are hunted by divine agents.

Her symbol is a black crescent with stars above a downward-pointing sword.

### 🕯️ Worship & Rites

- **Dreamwatch Vigils:** Guardians stay up to protect sleepers or the dying, chanting softly to invite Ontrix’s gaze.
- **Rite of Passing:** Bodies are bathed in starlight or moonlight, then cremated with prayers or buried with obsidian tokens.
- **Taboos:** Desecration of the dead, necromancy without divine sanction, and waking someone from a prophetic dream are all severe offenses.

### 🌑 Clerics & Powers

Clerics of Ontrix balance between light and shadow, offering protection and judgment.

- **Moonveil Ward:** Protects a sleeping target with a ghostly guardian that lashes out at intruders.
- **Silent Passage:** Guides a spirit safely into the afterlife—or delays the process until it is safe.
- **Shroud of Twilight:** Cloaks the party from dark-aligned enemies and calms restless spirits nearby.

Her servants wear **deep violet robes**, carry **blacksteel daggers**, and wield **nightglass holy symbols etched with stardust**.
