# 🌿 **Quton, God of Life**

**Divine Role:** The Benevolent Bloom  
**Religion Group:** *[[Religions/Elysian Fellowship\|Elysian Fellowship]]*  
**Titles:** Heart of the World, The Joy-Giver, He of Gentle Hands

### 🌸 Lore & Beliefs

Where [[NPCs/Deities/🔆 Zaldir, Primal of the Sun\|Zaldir]] brings fire and [[NPCs/Deities/📘 Votia, Goddess of Wisdom\|Votia]] brings wisdom, Quton brings _kindness_. He teaches that life is brief and precious—not to be hoarded, but shared. Many see him as a robed traveler, smiling and barefoot, walking village paths with wildflowers in his wake.

Legends say he cannot stay in one place for long, for his compassion would cause him to weep for all suffering. His tears are said to form sacred springs, which cure wounds and calm minds.

His holy symbol is a circle of clasped hands around a blooming flower.

### 💐 Worship & Rites
- **Shared Hearths:** Followers keep a corner of their homes open to guests or those in need.
- **Sacrifice Festivals:** Once per season, communities offer their wealth (food, tools, medicine) to strangers or travelers. 
- **Taboos:** Causing harm for profit is vile. Neglecting the suffering of others—especially when one has the means to help—is a grave offense.

### ✨ Clerics & Powers

Quton’s miracles are restorative and emotional, aiding both body and spirit.

- **Blooming Wards:** Create zones of safety, healing allies over time.
- **Communion of Kindred:** Link the senses and emotions of allies to coordinate actions and share courage.
- **Gift of the Moment:** A sudden miracle when selflessly aiding another—can stabilize, cleanse, or even resurrect.

His favored symbols include **braided cords, seed pouches, silver leaf amulets**, and **worn gloves blessed by a communal ritual**.
