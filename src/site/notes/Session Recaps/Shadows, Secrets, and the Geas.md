# May 15, 2025 : Shadows, Secrets, and the Geas

Battered, bloodied, and nearly broken, the party stood at the brink — only for the unexpected to unfold. Their foe, recognizing their tenacity, offered not death, but a pact. Bound by a powerful **Geas**, Landstryder became the vessel of an errand: to deliver a satchel to unknown acquaintances deep within the [[Shambled Forest\|Shambled Forest]]. 

> [!note] The Contract
>  You are to deliver this to acquaintances in the Shambled Forest. You may not see its content, nor would you allow members of your party to see its content.  They will feel your presence and approach when you've entered the forest far enough. You must go straight there and take no detours. Rest as you must. Complete this in 30 days]

 The mission is clear: no detours, no delays, and thirty days to see it done. Only when they reach deep enough into the forest will those meant to receive it reveal themselves.

Yet curiosity festers where mystery lingers.

Brr Brr, ever the cunning, tested fate with a sleight of hand. Inside the satchel, he felt three small objects — hard, ridged, yet smooth in parts. Unseen and unidentified, their minds race to think of what could be inside.

In the **Veiled Mausoleum**, the echoes of the past lingered. The coffins in the cult’s sanctum did not hold monsters, but martyrs — brave defenders from an age when the Temple still stood against darker tides. Their legacy weighed heavy in the silence.

Then came recklessness wrapped in curiosity. With only a heartbeat between life and death, Brr Brr delved alone into uncovered areas of the crypt — a thief on the edge of the void. Ignoring traps, he tried a locked armoire. A hiss of gas. Darkness. Collapse. Had it not been for Alban's timely concern and healing touch, the curious Kobald may have never risen again. Revived but undeterred, Brr Brr tried once more, recovering the garb of the cultists and escaping just before fate struck again.

And so, we begin once more.

The cracked stone of the **Eastern Graveyard** crunches beneath your boots as you emerge from the depths of the Mausoleum. Behind you: secrets, near-deaths, and unanswered questions. Before you: the looming Shambled Forest and the ticking clock of a spell-bound quest.
