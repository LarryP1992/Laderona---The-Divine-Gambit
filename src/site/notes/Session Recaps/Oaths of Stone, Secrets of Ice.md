# September 10, 2025: - Oaths of Stone, Secrets of Ice

As the Legion Execrator fell, he spat a final omen to Rokirus and Arabar: *“You will meet [[The Baronness\|The Baronness]] soon enough… and she will not be pleased.”* Then he burst into flame, leaving only ruin behind.

From the cultists’ remains you claimed treasures, from the ancient bones relics lost to time—
- The [[Titan’s Bulwark\|Titan’s Bulwark]], stone plate forged by the Gods for Rokirus’ bloodline, a divine gift to help protect Laderona from Nulda’s minions.
- A map, marking the pieces of [[The Crown of Eternal Passage\|The Crown of Eternal Passage]], the very artifact the [[Legion\|Legion]] seeks to summon the [[NPCs/Deities/Amon, Primal of Death or Demon Lord\|Demon Lord Amon]]. When Beedle touched it, a voice older than Laderona itself whispered: *“Your truth must remain hidden… for now, I grant you the gift of sight.”*

After a much-needed rest, the gems unearthed from the crater revealed a hidden doorway. Passing through, you emerged onto the edge of a frozen lake, where a crumbled wall exposed a tormented Dryad bound to a tree, beset by icy elementals.

Your party split—some to exploration, others to her rescue—when battle erupted on two fronts. And now, in the chaos, a massive ice bull bursts from beneath the lake, its horns goring Beedle before slamming him into the frozen ground. He lies motionless, the battle raging on.
