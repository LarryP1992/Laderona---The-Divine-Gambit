# June 25, 2025: The Wizard's Tower

Puzzle after puzzle. Riddles woven from arcane wit and ancient paranoia, each designed to keep the foolish — or the uninvited — from reaching the heights of the wizard’s spire. Yet, through persistence, cunning, and perhaps a touch of destiny, you ascended.

At the summit of the tower, among the clouds and forgotten knowledge, sat the figure you sought — a bent old man cloaked in worn brown robes, his beard a tangled silver cascade over stacks of crumbling tomes. His eyes, sharp beneath heavy lids, flickered upward as you entered, weighing strangers, measuring intent.

You came seeking aid for the one and only **Landstryder**, bound by affliction beyond mundane cure. But nothing comes freely in this world, least of all from a wizard.

Thus, the wagers began. Knowledge for knowledge. Secrets traded like coin...but not Wyzann's coin...put it back on your way down.

Sensing the latent magic you carry, his gaze settled first upon **Beedle**, motioning toward the hidden scroll within his pouch. The wizard read in silence — the air thick with tension — before handing it back with little more than a sardonic smirk and a cryptic, “Good luck.”

Next, the bow — a relic whispered to be touched by divine will itself — passed into his hands. Even he, steeped in centuries of study, showed a glimmer of intrigue.

But the final revelation dwarfed all else. Hidden deep within your pack, an artifact whose mere possession brands one for death — the rarest gems in all of Laderona, outlawed under pain of public execution. Its radiant glow emerged once more, casting fractured light across the dusty chamber. The [[World & Lore/Ore/Sunblaze Crystals\|Sunblaze Crystals]]

For a moment, even the wizard’s mask faltered — surprise, curiosity… perhaps fear. You had brought to his doorstep not only a plea for help but a relic powerful enough to reshape your fates — or end them.

What comes next? You decide.
