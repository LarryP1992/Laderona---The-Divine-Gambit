# July 9, 2025: Tea, Secrets, and the Shedding of Shackles

*The room was dim, warm with amber lamplight. A pot of tea steamed gently between the group and their mysterious host.*

[[Wyzan Dellmoor\|Wyzan Dellmoor]] _(with a small, sincere smile)_:
> “Sit and chat with me. At the very least, I do not get company very often, and you have come all this way.”

*And so they did. Over sips of spiced tea and cautious conversation, Wyzan offered something unexpected:*

Wyzan, unbeknown to most of the party, gathers a glittering handful of diamond dust. He spoke words not all of them understood—ancient, older than ink or echo. The dust swirled like ash on a current, then soaked into **Landstryder’s** skin. The binding spell dissipated with a silent finality.

**Beedle**, **Brr Brr**, and **Rokirus** glanced at each other. They recognized the cost. Roughly 100 gold in diamond dust, just… given.

Wyzan _(folding his hands)_:

> “Now, the Cryptwrought Gold curse—should you still wish to undo it—you’ll have two paths. One: find an assessor to price what was stolen, then pay its worth in diamond dust. But be warned, magic reveals truth, not guesswork.
> 
> Or… you can embark on a little journey, and collect ingredients for an alchemic solution. Brew it. Drink it. Return the treasure.”

They talked long after that, as the tea cooled and the shadows grew. Wyzan’s truths were half-buried in tone and implication—but some things were made clear:

- The leaders of the major religions? **Godlings**—children of gods themselves.
- Godlings live for centuries. Only one has ever been killed.
- New Godlings will soon walk the world again. Wyzan suspects their seeds have already been planted.
- Someone, perhaps even the Godlings, sent his party to die in the **Scarlet Barrens**.
- Wyzan has, over decades, send apprentices in an attempt to set teleportation circles in the capital of the Barrens: [[Khulzodin Nun\|Khulzodin Nun]]. All in hopes of returning to some unfinished research.

**Beedle**, ever-curious, poured over tomes over the next 2 days, searching for answers. Finally, something worth while. The ancient, **Scroll of the Shattered Veil** is written in **Vox Umbrarum**—the fabled **Noctisong**.

**Rokirus** received word of a fight stirring beneath one of the Upper District’s Manors. The address was whispered to him—violence brews underground.

But there is no time to linger.

**Next Destinations:**

- [[Gin Ulum\|Gin Ulum]]– along the way to their final destination. A place to recoup supplies and gather any necessary information for their next steps.
- Then across the jagged pass of **The Spine**, toward the cave whose mystery still calls.
