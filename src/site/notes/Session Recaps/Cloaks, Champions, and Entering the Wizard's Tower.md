# Cloaks, Champions, and Entering the Wizard's Tower

## The Streets of Theltgalor — Cloaks, Companions, and Deception

The streets of [[Theltgalor\|Theltgalor]] bustled beneath a slate-gray sky, tension thick as the sound of clanging armor close behind.

Yet fate, or perhaps fortune, intervened.

From the crowd surged another guard, intercepting the pursuit with clipped words and sharp posture. Words spoken, but inaudible. 

Riding in on spectral steed, beneath the steel helm and polished armor, Beedle recognized the voice of his once-lost companion: **Gil**, returned, clad in striking deep-purple plate that gleamed like twilight storm clouds.

> > "Sorry about him," the intercepting guard confessed, voice edged with authority.  
> > "He's been traveling with the Mage for a few days now. That mage's tongue could sour honey. Still… the cloak. Stolen goods can't walk free, not without consequence. Pay for it and clear the trace, or surrender it."


A dance of words followed, slick with half-truths and careful misdirection. But even silver tongues falter before the unerring mark of magic designed to reveal the hidden.

The cloak, heavy with arcane tracking, was reluctantly returned to the **Eldritch Emporium**… for now. But the whispered vow?  
_This is not over._

## Tavern Whispers — The Call of Combat

Meanwhile, across the taverns and lantern-lit streets, Rokirus, Landstryder, and Alban drifted among the townsfolk, ears sharp for opportunity. Their patience bore fruit when rumors of an unadvertised contest reached them — a place where reward could be high and reputations were carved in sweat and blood.

No time, no place revealed… but the fire in Rokirus's eyes was unmistakable. A fight, glorious and rich with coin, awaited.

The innkeeper, ever watching, confirmed whispers of an event — three days hence.

## Shadows Stir — Landstryder's Burden and Brr Brr's Scheme

But shadows twist deeper than coin and combat.

The creeping blight upon Landstryder's chest, festering with whispers of doom, gnawed at their resolve. Their hope? The enigmatic wizard beyond the city, in the looming tower of **Wyzan**. If the mage proved unwilling? A priest, destined to visit [[Theltgalor\|Theltgalor]] in **five days' time**, might hold the cure.

But as one problem loomed, another arose under the cover of darkness.

That night, Brr Brr, ever daring, returned to the **Eldritch Emporium**, fingers deft and practiced. The lock surrendered with a soft _click_, the door drifting inward. But calamity followed — a wail of alarms echoed across rooftops, sirens slicing the night.

Brr Brr vanished into the dark, scaling to safety, unseen.

## Wyzan's Tower — Of Owls and Arcana

Dawn broke cool and golden, though not all awoke renewed. Landstryder's affliction still present — a gnawing reminder that not all spoils come without cost.

The party set forth, the spires of **Wyzan's Tower** clawing at the clouds ahead. An animated skeleton, sentinel of bone and ancient magics, ushered them within.

Mysteries bloomed like moonlight on stone:

Five stone dais, five stacks of books, each etched with a single word:

> [!INFO] Book Engravings
> - **AFRAID**
> - **ANGRY**
> - **HAPPY**
> - **JEALOUS**
> - **SAD**

Upon each, an owl perched, crystalline eyes clear and unblinking. In the room's heart, a swirling orb of mesmerizing color pulsed with hidden power.

Curiosity overcame caution. Gil reached first, his hand upon an owl. In an instant, the eyes flared — once clear, now brilliant yellow. The others followed, triggering hues yet unseen:

> [!INFO] Colors
> - Clear
> - Yellow
> - Orange
> - Red
> - Pink
> - Green
> - Blue

But the orb pulses still. With each ripple of its arcane heartbeat, unseen effects take root, fate's threads tightening around the heroes.

Already, Beedle, Brr Brr, Rokirus, and Landstryder have felt its touch.

And that is where we will begin todays session, with those folks rolling a d6
