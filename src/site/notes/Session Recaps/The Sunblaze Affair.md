# May 29, 2025: The Sunblaze Affair

The party returned to the shadowed streets of [[Theltgalor\|Theltgalor]], where the looming spires seemed to whisper of secrets best left untouched. They sought the counsel of [[Garran Holt\|Garran]].

Garran, ever calculating, met them with the questions that had weighed on him since their departure.  
_"Where lies [[The Veiled Mausoleum\|The Veiled Mausoleum]]? And to what end is the piece that was stolen?"_

Their answers brought little clarity. The piece remained shrouded in mystery — neither its true nature nor its greater purpose uncovered. But a darker revelation soon emerged: they had been bested by a warlock of the cult, forced into service, and entrusted with a satchel meant for delivery into the depths of the [[Shambled Forest\|Shambled Forest]].

Cautious of the satchel’s ominous contents, the party requested that one of Garran’s trusted men inspect it, fearing what it holds might damn them further. One of Garran's captains took the burden, vanishing into the private chambers. When he returned, his face was pale, his eyes wide with alarm. He pulled Garran aside, speaking in hushed urgency.

Inside the satchel were **three [[World & Lore/Ore/Sunblaze Crystals\|Sunblaze Crystals]]**.

Garran’s face hardened, his voice low but absolute.  
_"You cannot carry these. I am bound to report this to the [[Night Priestess Nycterra Elysia\|Night Priestess]] herself. The Crystals must be delivered directly to **[[Tarruk-Morr\|Tarruk-Morr]]**. If another had discovered you with them…"_  
His gaze darkened.  
_"We would be preparing your public execution."_

### **The Mark of the Contract**

Dawn brought no peace. **Landstryder** awoke unrested, his sleep plagued by unnatural fatigue. His hand drifted to his chest, where he found an inky, white stain in the shape of a symbol — the same accursed face engraved on the ancient coins taken from the mausoleum. The thieves tole has now manifest: he had fallen under a mental stress of **Sleepless**.

When he faltered and violated the terms of the dark pact made with the Cultist Warlock, a wave of excruciating pain wracked his mind. His body trembled beneath its weight. Fortunately, this day brought little demand for his strength. With the care of **Alban**, their faithful druidic healer, he endured.

### **The Heist in Theltgalor**

While Landstryder recovered, the restless hearts of **Brr Brr** and **Beedle** carried them into the heart of the Upper District, where wealth and arcane wonders were ripe for the taking.

Their plan was bold: a daring theft in broad daylight, beneath the high towers and vigilant watch of the city’s elite. They wielded already stolen artifacts and clever spells to mask their movements, weaving through market stalls and ornate storefronts.

But fate, as always, was watchful.

Just as their gambit unfolded, a sharp voice cut through the murmuring crowd. A mage, flanked by two armored knights, raised his hand and pointed directly at them.  
_"There are your items."_

Panic struck. Beedle vanished from sight, slipping into the arcane veil, while Brr Brr faced the wrath of one of the knights — a brute of a man whose voice sent nearby citizens scattering into alleyways and clearing the street.  
_"The cloak, now!"_  
The evidence was undeniable. Magic does not lie. It was indeed the stolen cloak.

Brr Brr attempted to talk his way free, but the knight’s patience frayed quickly. With no other recourse, Brr Brr bolted — the chase was on.

As the pursuit twisted through the alley, Beedle, reappears quickly surveying the situation. When another knight confronted him and demanded the ring, Beedle surrendered it — but not without subtlety. With an incomprehensible incantation, he cast **[[Slow\|Slow]]** upon the mage, dulling their reactions, but doesn't look like the knight fell to its effect. The spell took hold, its effects crawling into the mage’s limbs like molasses, though he could not discern the caster.

### **The Pursuit Unfolds**

Brr Brr and his pursuer rounded the corner of the storefront, emerging on the opposite side, scarcely sixty feet from where they had begun. Up ahead them, Beedle, the mage, and the second knight came into full view. The air crackled with tension, both groups now locked in each other's sight.

And so we leave our heroes poised at the edge of chaos, where steel, sorcery, and consequence will soon collide...
