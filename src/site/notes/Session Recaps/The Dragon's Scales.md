# October 08, 2025 : The Dragon's Scales

Venturing deeper into the ancient dungeon, the party ended up finding themselves face-to-face with stone gargoyles—some serpent-like in form—while draconic heads carved into the chamber walls unleashed devastating rays of elemental energy. Amid the chaos and stone dust of the final gargoyle’s fall, something glittered: a **blue dragon scale**, revealed where the creature had once stood.

Their search led them to a darkened alcove where an **onyx gem** lay hidden, quietly pulsing with arcane energy.

Further exploration revealed an oddity: a seemingly ordinary **unlocked door** blocked by an **invisible wall**—one that only disappeared when the door was locked. Using magic to destroy iron bars impeding progress, the group puzzled over the enchantment’s function.

Meanwhile, **Rokirus** had begun snuffing out the lights in the dungeon chambers, one by one. When the last torch in the entryway was extinguished, a faint glow appeared from beneath a worn rug, revealing a **silver dragon scale**  

Regrouping, **Alban** summoned a baboon familiar to manipulate the locking mechanism from the other side, allowing the full party to bypass the invisible wall and proceed together.

In the final chamber, the party discovered the resting place of the **Purple Angel statue** previously encountered. They placed the statue upon its proper **dais**, and rotated all the other angel statues to face their respective counterparts—pairings determined by the **combined color of the diamonds** they each held. When the last angel aligned, a stone panel receded, revealing the **red dragon scale** hidden within the floor.

Now in possession of all the **Dragon Scales**, the adventurers made their way back toward the central **Dragon Statue**, only to find Alban’s baboon familiar slain by a **massive black ooze**.

Acting swiftly, the party employed teleportation magic to bypass the invisible barrier and orchestrated a trap: luring the ooze into the hall, teleporting behind it, and sealing it within the corridor. Their strategy succeeded, and the ooze now festers behind locked doors—at least for the time being.

With the Scales in hand and the immediate threat behind them, the path forward begins to glimmer with possibility.
