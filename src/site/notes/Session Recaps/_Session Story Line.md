# Cloaks, Champions, and Entering the Wizard's Tower

## The Streets of Theltgalor — Cloaks, Companions, and Deception

The streets of [[Theltgalor\|Theltgalor]] bustled beneath a slate-gray sky, tension thick as the sound of clanging armor close behind.

Yet fate, or perhaps fortune, intervened.

From the crowd surged another guard, intercepting the pursuit with clipped words and sharp posture. Words spoken, but inaudible. 

Riding in on spectral steed, beneath the steel helm and polished armor, Beedle recognized the voice of his once-lost companion: **Gil**, returned, clad in striking deep-purple plate that gleamed like twilight storm clouds.


> [!Quote] The intercepting guard turns to Brr Brr and his company, while the other knights strides off the other direction.
> > "Sorry about him," the intercepting guard confessed, voice edged with authority.  
> > "He's been traveling with the Mage for a few days now. That mage's tongue could sour honey. Still… the cloak. Stolen goods can't walk free, not without consequence. Pay for it and clear the trace, or surrender it."


A dance of words followed, slick with half-truths and careful misdirection. But even silver tongues falter before the unerring mark of magic designed to reveal the hidden.

The cloak, heavy with arcane tracking, was reluctantly returned to the **Eldritch Emporium**… for now. But the whispered vow?  
_This is not over._

## Tavern Whispers — The Call of Combat

Meanwhile, across the taverns and lantern-lit streets, Rokirus, Landstryder, and Alban drifted among the townsfolk, ears sharp for opportunity. Their patience bore fruit when rumors of an unadvertised contest reached them — a place where reward could be high and reputations were carved in sweat and blood.

No time, no place revealed… but the fire in Rokirus's eyes was unmistakable. A fight, glorious and rich with coin, awaited.

The innkeeper, ever watching, confirmed whispers of an event — three days hence.

---

## Shadows Stir — Landstryder's Burden and Brr Brr's Scheme

But shadows twist deeper than coin and combat.

The creeping blight upon Landstryder's chest, festering with whispers of doom, gnawed at their resolve. Their hope? The enigmatic wizard beyond the city, in the looming tower of **Wyzan**. If the mage proved unwilling? A priest, destined to visit [[Theltgalor\|Theltgalor]] in **five days' time**, might hold the cure.

But as one problem loomed, another arose under the cover of darkness.

That night, Brr Brr, ever daring, returned to the **Eldritch Emporium**, fingers deft and practiced. The lock surrendered with a soft _click_, the door drifting inward. But calamity followed — a wail of alarms echoed across rooftops, sirens slicing the night.

Brr Brr vanished into the dark, scaling to safety, unseen.

---

## Wyzan's Tower — Of Owls and Arcana

Dawn broke cool and golden, though not all awoke renewed. Landstryder's affliction still present — a gnawing reminder that not all spoils come without cost.

The party set forth, the spires of **Wyzan's Tower** clawing at the clouds ahead. An animated skeleton, sentinel of bone and ancient magics, ushered them within.

Mysteries bloomed like moonlight on stone:

Five stone dais, five stacks of books, each etched with a single word:

> [!INFO] Book Engravings
> - **AFRAID**
> - **ANGRY**
> - **HAPPY**
> - **JEALOUS**
> - **SAD**

Upon each, an owl perched, crystalline eyes clear and unblinking. In the room's heart, a swirling orb of mesmerizing color pulsed with hidden power.

Curiosity overcame caution. Gil reached first, his hand upon an owl. In an instant, the eyes flared — once clear, now brilliant yellow. The others followed, triggering hues yet unseen:

> [!INFO] Colors
> - Clear
> - Yellow
> - Orange
> - Red
> - Pink
> - Green
> - Blue

But the orb pulses still. With each ripple of its arcane heartbeat, unseen effects take root, fate's threads tightening around the heroes.

Already, Beedle, Brr Brr, Rokirus, and Landstryder have felt its touch.

And that is where we will begin todays session, with those folks rolling a d6

# The Sunblaze Affair

The party returned to the shadowed streets of [[Theltgalor\|Theltgalor]], where the looming spires seemed to whisper of secrets best left untouched. They sought the counsel of [[Garran Holt\|Garran]].

Garran, ever calculating, met them with the questions that had weighed on him since their departure.  
_"Where lies [[The Veiled Mausoleum\|The Veiled Mausoleum]]? And to what end is the piece that was stolen?"_

Their answers brought little clarity. The piece remained shrouded in mystery — neither its true nature nor its greater purpose uncovered. But a darker revelation soon emerged: they had been bested by a warlock of the cult, forced into service, and entrusted with a satchel meant for delivery into the depths of the [[Shambled Forest\|Shambled Forest]].

Cautious of the satchel’s ominous contents, the party requested that one of Garran’s trusted men inspect it, fearing what it holds might damn them further. One of Garran's captains took the burden, vanishing into the private chambers. When he returned, his face was pale, his eyes wide with alarm. He pulled Garran aside, speaking in hushed urgency.

Inside the satchel were **three [[World & Lore/Ore/Sunblaze Crystals\|Sunblaze Crystals]]**.

Garran’s face hardened, his voice low but absolute.  
_"You cannot carry these. I am bound to report this to the [[Night Priestess Nycterra Elysia\|Night Priestess]] herself. The Crystals must be delivered directly to **[[Tarruk-Morr\|Tarruk-Morr]]**. If another had discovered you with them…"_  
His gaze darkened.  
_"We would be preparing your public execution."_

### **The Mark of the Contract**

Dawn brought no peace. **Landstryder** awoke unrested, his sleep plagued by unnatural fatigue. His hand drifted to his chest, where he found an inky, white stain in the shape of a symbol — the same accursed face engraved on the ancient coins taken from the mausoleum. The thieves tole has now manifest: he had fallen under a mental stress of **Sleepless**.

When he faltered and violated the terms of the dark pact made with the Cultist Warlock, a wave of excruciating pain wracked his mind. His body trembled beneath its weight. Fortunately, this day brought little demand for his strength. With the care of **Alban**, their faithful druidic healer, he endured.

---

### **The Heist in Theltgalor**

While Landstryder recovered, the restless hearts of **Brr Brr** and **Beedle** carried them into the heart of the Upper District, where wealth and arcane wonders were ripe for the taking.

Their plan was bold: a daring theft in broad daylight, beneath the high towers and vigilant watch of the city’s elite. They wielded already stolen artifacts and clever spells to mask their movements, weaving through market stalls and ornate storefronts.

But fate, as always, was watchful.

Just as their gambit unfolded, a sharp voice cut through the murmuring crowd. A mage, flanked by two armored knights, raised his hand and pointed directly at them.  
_"There are your items."_

Panic struck. Beedle vanished from sight, slipping into the arcane veil, while Brr Brr faced the wrath of one of the knights — a brute of a man whose voice sent nearby citizens scattering into alleyways and clearing the street.  
_"The cloak, now!"_  
The evidence was undeniable. Magic does not lie. It was indeed the stolen cloak.

Brr Brr attempted to talk his way free, but the knight’s patience frayed quickly. With no other recourse, Brr Brr bolted — the chase was on.

As the pursuit twisted through the alley, Beedle, reappears quickly surveying the situation. When another knight confronted him and demanded the ring, Beedle surrendered it — but not without subtlety. With an incomprehensible incantation, he cast **[[Slow\|Slow]]** upon the mage, dulling their reactions, but doesn't look like the knight fell to its effect. The spell took hold, its effects crawling into the mage’s limbs like molasses, though he could not discern the caster.

---

### **The Pursuit Unfolds**

Brr Brr and his pursuer rounded the corner of the storefront, emerging on the opposite side, scarcely sixty feet from where they had begun. Up ahead them, Beedle, the mage, and the second knight came into full view. The air crackled with tension, both groups now locked in each other's sight.

And so we leave our heroes poised at the edge of chaos, where steel, sorcery, and consequence will soon collide...

# May 15, 2025 : Shadows, Secrets, and the Geas

Battered, bloodied, and nearly broken, the party stood at the brink — only for the unexpected to unfold. Their foe, recognizing their tenacity, offered not death, but a pact. Bound by a powerful **Geas**, Landstryder became the vessel of an errand: to deliver a satchel to unknown acquaintances deep within the [[Shambled Forest\|Shambled Forest]]. 

> [!note] The Contract
>  You are to deliver this to acquaintances in the Shambled Forest. You may not see its content, nor would you allow members of your party to see its content.  They will feel your presence and approach when you've entered the forest far enough. You must go straight there and take no detours. Rest as you must. Complete this in 30 days

 The mission is clear: no detours, no delays, and thirty days to see it done. Only when they reach deep enough into the forest will those meant to receive it reveal themselves.

Yet curiosity festers where mystery lingers.

Brr Brr, ever the cunning, tested fate with a sleight of hand. Inside the satchel, he felt three small objects — hard, ridged, yet smooth in parts. Unseen and unidentified, their minds race to think of what could be inside.

In the **Veiled Mausoleum**, the echoes of the past lingered. The coffins in the cult’s sanctum did not hold monsters, but martyrs — brave defenders from an age when the Temple still stood against darker tides. Their legacy weighed heavy in the silence.

Then came recklessness wrapped in curiosity. With only a heartbeat between life and death, Brr Brr delved alone into uncovered areas of the crypt — a thief on the edge of the void. Ignoring traps, he tried a locked armoire. A hiss of gas. Darkness. Collapse. Had it not been for Alban's timely concern and healing touch, the curious Kobald may have never risen again. Revived but undeterred, Brr Brr tried once more, recovering the garb of the cultists and escaping just before fate struck again.

And so, we begin once more.

The cracked stone of the **Eastern Graveyard** crunches beneath your boots as you emerge from the depths of the Mausoleum. Behind you: secrets, near-deaths, and unanswered questions. Before you: the looming Shambled Forest and the ticking clock of a spell-bound quest.
