# November 05, 2025: The Heart of the Forest

# The Heart of the Forest
With Alban deep in focus, casting the final stages of his restorative magic on the blighted tree at the forest’s center, your party stood as his shield—determined to protect him at all costs.

Blight wolves and twisted treants surged from the forest’s shadow, their corrupted forms lashing out. Though you triumphed over the first wave, the danger was far from over. From every direction came the sounds of more threats—cawing crows, howling beasts, and the pounding of countless feet rushing toward you.

As Alban’s spell reached its end, the tree pulsed with magical light, offering a moment of hope… before fading once again into its corrupted state. Despair crept in. Had you failed? With enemies drawing near—just 120 feet and closing—the weight of the situation pressed down on you.

Then, in a sudden burst of radiant brilliance, the tree erupted with light. Temporarily blinded, you blinked against the glare. As your vision cleared, what you saw left you breathless.

The tree—fully healed. Vibrant leaves sprouting. A wave of restorative magic rolled out from its trunk, purging the corruption around it. The blighted creatures charging toward you slowed, shimmered… and changed. The wolves, now healthy and natural. The hawks, feathers brown and eyes clear. The treants, once monstrous, now resembling the newly healed tree.

Alban, eyes lifted, caught a single falling leaf. As it touched his hands, it hardened—transforming into a leaf shaped key. The trunk of the tree creaked open, revealing a spiral stair descending into the depths below.

A new path has opened—but what lies beneath the forest’s heart?
